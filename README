OpenR2 - MFC/R2 call setup library

OpenR2 is a library that implements the MFC/R2 signalling over E1 lines using
the Zapata Telephony interface. The MF R2 tones required for the signaling are
not generated by the library, the user must provide a MF interface the library will
use when needed, that's why this library does not depend directly on spandsp, libteletone
or zaptel for tone generation (depends on zaptel for ABCD bits and general media transmission though)

Dependencies:

zaptel - a reasonably recent version of zaptel is enough.

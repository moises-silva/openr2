OpenR2 - MFC/R2 call setup library
http://www.libopenr2.org/
http://code.google.com/p/openr2/

OpenR2 is a library that implements the MFC/R2 signalling over E1 lines using
the Zapata Telephony interface (or DAHDI). The MF R2 tones required for the signaling are
generated by code borrowed from the LGPL library SpanDSP written by Steve Underwood, 
the user has the option to provide a MF interface to use his own MF R2 tone generation
and detection so the library will use them when needed, that's why this library does not 
depend directly on spandsp, libteletone or zaptel for tone generation and detection
(depends on zaptel for CAS bits and general media transmission though)

r2test is the program included with the library. When a zaptel version with R2 MF support 
is detected by the configure script, r2test.conf can use zaptel tone generation instead of 
OpenR2 built-in spandsp generation.

Dependencies:

- libc
- Zaptel/DAHDI - OpenR2 is known to work with Zaptel 1.2, 1.4 and DAHDI

Support, bugs and limitations:

- This is a not thread-safe library by design, application code is responsible for locking 
  r2chan and r2context structures if they really want thread-safe access.

- If you have a question that is related to the usage of openr2 in Asterisk, send an e-mail to
  the asterisk-r2 mailing list:  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-r2/

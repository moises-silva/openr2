- implement CAS persistence check for all signals

- warn users about -DTRACE_STACKS causing infinite recursion if calling openr2
  APIs from logging functions, probably we should not put OR2_CHAN_STACK on some
  functions?

- handle ANI restricted, set ANI restricted

- should check for error return in MF init routines

- remove openr2_proto public APIs? leave just openr2_context and openr2_chan APIs?

- r2context access to members thread safe.

- include thread id in the call logging
- improve context error reporting 
currently liberr sucks and its flawed, won't work on a multithread environment, 
in fact, the whole r2context thing is not thread-safe, probably some parts should be?

- implement CAS persistence check for all signals

- implement configuration file to alter tone definitions

- warn users about -DTRACE_STACKS causing infinite recursion if calling openr2
  APIs from logging functions, probably we should not put OR2_CHAN_STACK on some
  functions?

- handle ANI restricted, set ANI restricted 

- remove openr2_proto public APIs? leave just openr2_context and openr2_chan APIs?

- Port to Windows

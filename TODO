== This TODO list is in order of importance (what I think could be important for users to have) ==

- block calls per specific category
mfcr2_category_block=1,5,7 (that should block categories 1 5 and 7 whatever they are)

- Add metering pulse on demand after answering

The Answer has Forward "0 0" and backward "0 1"
Metering will change from  "|0 0|0 1|" and  to "|0 0|1 1|" for 150ms
before changing back to "|0 0| 0 1|"
it's like when a caller calls in, we answer the call then play voice prompt asking 
if the caller wants to use the service by pressing DTMF if not, hang them up.
Once the caller press whatever digit, we then send metering pulse to tell telco we 
want to start charging.

== This TODO list is in order of importance (what I think is more important for users to have) ==

- Send logs to syslog
- DTMF/R2
- Add support for use 1 variant for outgoing calls and one for incoming calls
- Port to Windows
- Port to Mac OS
- Add metering pulse on demand after answering
The Answer has Forward "0 0" and backward "0 1"
Metering will change from  "|0 0|0 1|" and  to "|0 0|1 1|" for 150ms
before changing back to "|0 0| 0 1|"
it's like when a caller calls in
we answer the call
then play voice prompt asking if the caller wants to use the service by pressing DTMF
if not, hang them up
once the caller press whatever digit, we then send metering pulse to tell telco we want to start charging
so, it will be sent only once 
but if we want to change the tariff during the call we send again I think
in my services I only send once

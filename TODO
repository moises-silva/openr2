- Add API to manually put lines into BLOCKED (openr2_proto_set_blocked)

- implement CAS persistence check for all signals

- implement configuration file to alter tone definitions

- warn users about -DTRACE_STACKS causing infinite recursion if calling openr2
  APIs from logging functions, probably we should not put OR2_CHAN_STACK on some
  functions?

- handle ANI restricted, set ANI restricted 

- remove openr2_proto public APIs? leave just openr2_context and openr2_chan APIs?

- r2context access to members thread safe.

- Port to Windows

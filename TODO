- Since the signal used to request the calling party category and the signal
  used to request the next ANI digit can be the same for some (all?) of the
  R2 variants, a variable is needed to track if the category was already sent

- warn users about -DTRACE_STACKS causing infinite recursion if calling openr2
  APIs from logging functions, probably we should not put OR2_CHAN_STACK on some
  functions?

- when expected ANI = 0 should we send category request or just change to group II?

- handle ANI restricted, set ANI restricted

- remove openr2_proto public APIs? leave just openr2_context and openr2_chan APIs?

- should check for error return in MF init routines

- should check and report errors when calling set_abcd_signal in r2proto.c

- r2context access to members thread safe.

- add support for DNIS-1, repeat all dnis and that stuff, is it worth?
- add nocharge=yes|no to allow users to decide whether or not calls should be charged
- implement brazil forced release (0x0 for clear back instead of 0xC)
- implement CAS persistence check for all signals
- Port to Windows

- Be able to alter max_dnis in runtime for a specific channel. This could help
  when multiple length of DNIS is expected (ie from a PBX) and we're in a variant
  that works with DNIS timeout as signal to END of DNIS. Instead of waiting for
  the timeout, Asterisk or FreeSwitch or x Client could change the MAX DNIS in
  a per call/per channel basis with dial plan rules, therefore, if the DNIS starts
  with a given prefix, it could set MAX DNIS to 8 digits or whatever

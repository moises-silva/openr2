Description: MFC/R2 call setup library - Development
 OpenR2 is a library that implements the MFC/R2 signalling over E1 lines using
 the Zapata Telephony interface. The MF R2 tones required for the signaling are
 generated by code borrowed from the LGPL library SpanDSP written by Steve
 Underwood, the user has the option to provide a MF interface to use his own
 MF R2 tone generation and detection so the library will use them when needed,
 that's why this library does not depend directly on spandsp, libteletone or
 zaptel for tone generation and detection (depends on zaptel for ABCD bits and
 general media transmission though)
 This package contains libraries and header files for developing applications.
